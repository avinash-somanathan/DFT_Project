The following is tihe instruction for compiling and executing the parser. 
1. Upload every file to your UNIX account (Aludra or viterbi-scf1) using any FTP program, e.g., FileZilla
* Untar circuit.tar.gz before or after the upload. 
2. Go to the directory where files are located
3. Compile the CLI using this command: g++ -o readckt readckt_print.cpp
4. Execute the CLI: ./readckt
5. Functions available are -
	-READ filename (Reads a circuit file and populates the datastructure for each node)
	-LEVEL (NOTE - READ must be executed before level, this levelizes the files and stores levels for all nodes)
	-SIMUL (NOTE - READ must be executed before simul, this simulates the circuits in an event driver manner)
	-PC (prints the circuit stored in memory)
	-QUIT (quits)

Please use PC after level to check the level of each node.

SIMUL will display the result in command line at the end of the execution.
